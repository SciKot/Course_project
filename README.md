# Final project of C++ course
This is simple realization of the SearchServer class, which allows you to search in the document database. 
The constructor of the SearchServer class accepts an input stream containing a database of documents. 
One document is one line of the input stream; documents consist of words separated by one or more spaces; words consist of lowercase Latin letters.

The AddQueriesStream method performs the actual search. It accepts an input stream of search queries and an output stream for recording search results.
One query is one line in the query_input stream; each search query consists of words separated by one or more spaces; words in queries consist of lowercase Latin letters

The result of processing a search query is a set of up to five most relevant documents.

For each search query, the AddQueriesStream method output to the search_results_output stream one line in the format [query text]:
{docid: <value>, hitcount: <value>} {docid: <value>, hitcount: <value>}..., where docid is the document identifier, 
and hitcount â€” the value of the relevance metric for this document (that is the total number of occurrences of all query words in this document).

The UpdateDocumentBase method replaces the current document database with a new one, which is contained in the document_input stream.

The AddQueriesStream method is ready for the UpdateDocumentBase method to be executed in parallel with it and vice versa.
