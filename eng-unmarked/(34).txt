In the modern world, people try to make life easierand more convenient. Based on this, a few decades ago genetically-modified food was invented. Now some people believe that the development of this type of food must be discontinued, whereas other people think that GMO products are humanity’s future, so they should not be banned.
As far as I am concerned, people and companies must stop making genetically-modified food and governments should contribute to this. Firstly, It is proven by scientific studies that GMO foods contain substances that may cause diseases and even death to some kinds of species, even including humans. For instance, mice and butterflies cannot survive with these foods. Secondly, genetically modified foods can pose significant allergy risks to people. It is caused by the fact that people give chickens, cows and other animals special antibiotics and hormones which are harmful to humans.
But there is another point of view. According to it, GMO products are too easy to produce, so there is no need to ban them. For example, it is much easier to raise GMO crops because all of their examples have a stronger ability to resist pests.
I do not agree with the opposing opinion because «easier» does not mean «better». Scientists have already confirmed that GMO food is harmful to people and animals because of several kinds of substances that are not yet proven to be safe.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that genetically-modified food is very dangerous, so the production of this type of food must be officially stopped.
