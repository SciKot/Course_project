It is a generally accepted fact that stress plays an important role in our life. A lot of people hold the opinion that sports help to fight stress. Nevertheless others contradict them by saying that there are others ways to fight stress. And I will give my point of view on this issue.
As far as I am concerned there are a lot of ways to fight stress. The first thing that need to be said hobbies help people do not think about their problems. Another argument is that doctors help people giving them good advices. And finally medicine that people can buy everywhere. 
However there are people who think on the contrary/ In their mind sport is the best way to fight stress, because people can concentrate only on sport and do not think about their problem. What is more sport help to find new power inside people to fight stress.
It may be true, but I cannot agree with the opposing idea completely as I strongly believe that people will use more comfortable and strongless ways to fight stress.
To draw a conclusion I would like to stress that ‘’so many men, so many minds’’ , but I firmly stick to my understanding of the problem in the written above essay.
