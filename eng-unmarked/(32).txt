There are two opposite points of view on whether pupils should be made read a lot in summer . Some people are sure that teachers must make students read hard in summer until others think it is wrong to force pupils read lots of books in summer Holidays. I would like to express my point of view on this problem.
I am strongly convinced that it is good to make pupils read a lot in summer. To begin with it helps them to pass their exams. Students may not be aware of this but every book that they read increases their test result. Moreover, summer reading can reduce workload during school year. If a student read the book in the summer when he will only need 2 remember same points for the book during the school year.
However, there is another point of view on this Issue. Opponents of my view say that it is wrong to make pupils read a lot in summer. The reason is summer Holidays are the time to relax. Children want to spend a lot of time outdoors playing games.
Nevertheless I cannot agree with the opposite opinion. I am sure that's reading does not take much Time. Children can read at least one hour a day and it will not harm their relaxation. 
In conclusion there are two points of view on this issue. I strongly feel that teachers must make children to read in summer Holidays.
