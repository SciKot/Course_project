There are two opposite points of view on summer reading . Some people are sure that it is necessary task to make pupils read a lot. Others, on the contrary, argue that it is unacceptable to set a large amount of literature for the summer.
I strongly believe to make pupils read a lot of books is great opportunity. First of all, obligatory reading is the part of educational process which tissue responsibility to read all books from their list. Secondly on the summer weekend most of pupils have a lot of free time maybe some of them are bored then the book comes to rescue. Thirdly the process of reading develops clear thinking and imagination.
However, some people think differently. They are sure that most of students cannot manage to read all the books from the list. Moreover, pupils forgot the plot names description and can barely recall anything. Besides the book's content is usually different from personal preferences. That it is difficult to read that you do not like.
I cannot totally agree with this point of view because if you spend summer how you want you can get really lazy fall behind in your studies. In addition, books develop our minds and also add to our vocabulary. 
To sum up I think pupils have to read a lot in summer this has a beneficial effect on their development. Reading books will never be Superfluous.
