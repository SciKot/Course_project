Books or their screened versions? It seems that this question began to trouble people as soon as television appeared. Starting from that time, people had divided into two groupes: those who enjoy reading and those who enjoy watching film versions. 
Speaking about me, I’d rather read a book. Firstly, reading books is the oldest activity. Therefore, when I open a book, I feel connected to history, dive into the past, whereas watching a film takes me nowhere. Secondly, while reading, I get pleasure out of crispy paper and smell of a book, when a film has none of these qualities. Finally, authors always leave something to think about to their readers, to use our imagination. 
Alternatively, there are people who prefer watching films based on famous books. I understand them partially. In the beginning, those films are always abridged. It means that some parts of the text are omitted, which ends up in the loss of the zest of the original work. Furthermore, a film is directed by a different person, so it is another piece of work with its own notions, purposes and impressions. Lastly, people, who go to a cinema to watch a best-seller based on an excellent book, don’t stand a chance to stop it and pay attention to the facts they’ve missed, while readers may have a break and get back to each moment they firstly ignored.
To sum up, this disagreement is endless. Each person should decide for himself whether to choose a film or a book.
