There are two opposite opinions on whether online education is the best form of education. Some people are sure but learning from home is the most convenient way of studying. Others On the contrary argue that there is nothing better than being educated at school.
I personally consider that distance learning is the best form of education. Here are some arguments that support my idea. Firstly, it is very comfortable and cozy to stay in your own room while studying. Secondly students are able to make the schedule suitable for them. Thirdly you do not have to wait for others to finish the same work and you can take the time you need to learn the subject.
Nevertheless, there are those who opposite my point of view. According to them going to school is the best way to get education. To start with students are obliged to learn the program so they cannot miss anything. In addition, do this school schedule is the most thought-out schedule.
I cannot agree with the opponents of my idea. In my opinion the best schedule for students is the one they make themselves which is mostly convenient for distance learning.
All in all, there are indeed two points of view on whether distance learning is the best form of education. And everything said above into consideration i still strongly believe that online study is the most convenient way to be educated.
