There are two opposite opinions on whether among old people we call friends there is only one real friend or whether there are more. Some people are sure that there is can only one actual sincere  friend in your life .Others believe that one can have many truly devoted friends .
I personally consider that you can have more than one true friend. Firstly, you met so many people in your life that it is simple to find two or three real friends among them. Secondly, all of us are different but many of us are sincere and honest which means that there is no reason why there must be only one true friend. Thirdly, there are many beautiful people in the world the only question is whether you find them or not.
Nevertheless, there are those who what was my idea. According to them you can find only one true friend. To start with it is hard to find a person with gentle interest and good intentions. Besides, you can only once if ever be lucky enough to find real friend.
I cannot agree with that opposers of my opinion. To my mind it is not that hard to find such person if you are sociable and open to others.
Oh no there are indeed two opposite opinions on this question. Taking everything said above into consideration I still strongly believe that there can be more than one true friend in your life.
