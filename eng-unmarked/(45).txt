All people have an education nowadays. Some people believe that education is the most important part in people lives. Whereas others think that work is the most important element of a person's life. As far as I am concerned education is the most important element of people lives. Firstly, if you have a good education, you can get a prestigious job. People with higher education are needed nowadays. Secondly, usually people with a good education are more intelligent. They know a lot, are interested in various things. Also, during the training, they can meet different interesting people. On the other hand, other people believe that the work is the most important part in people lives. They believe that you can work without education. These people do not understand why they should spend time studying at a College or University if they can go straight to work. 
I do not agree with the above idea because education is very important. When a person learns, they can learn something new. Also, a person with an education will hold higher positions. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that education is very important. If a person wants to achieve something in life, he need to get a good education.
