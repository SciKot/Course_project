Nowadays some teachers and parents make children to read in summer. There are different points of view on this topic. Some people are sure that reading in summer is important aspect for pupils. Some others argue that there is no necessity to read a lot during Holidays.
In my opinion, it is right to make pupils read in a lot in summer. Firstly, summer Holidays are the longest pupils’ Holidays. So it is special and rare time when children can devote for education and development. Secondly, the fact of reading imports our speech. And grammatically correct speech can be useful for future carrier.
However, some people argue against usefulness of reading a lot in summer. They claim that children do not have to read a lot in Holidays. They believe that pupils need do enjoy their childhood till they can.
I am strongly against this opinion. People who say that it is not necessary to get knowledge in summer are absolutely wrong. Thank to these actions you can calmly enjoy your future life.
In conclusion I'd like to say that it is right to make pupils read a lot in summer.
