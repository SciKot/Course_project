People have been making a negative influence on ecology for ages. Some people say that climate change is dreadful for the human population, others argue that it is not such bad. In this essay, I would like to express my point of view on this issue. 
As far as I am concerned, climate change is a huge problem nowadays. The average Earth temperature has raised for 5Celcius degrees since 1800. Also, Antarctic ice is melting and the ocean level is rising. Thus, more and more landsides drown into the water. Those people who live on the coastline can lose their homes. Not to say about animals many of which have already lost their natural habitats.
However, there is another point of view claiming that climate change cannot do anything to humanity. Many people say that even if there will be global deserting or the new ice age they will continue living their lives.
I do not agree with the above ideas because even those changes which we see now affect people’s health. For instance, ozone holes are the reason for skin cancer many people die to. So, climate change is already killing humans.
In conclusion, I would like to stress thatman-made climate change poses a real threat to human life and now anyone can deny it.
