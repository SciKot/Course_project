Some people are sure that the best way to get education is to study remotely. Others, On the contrary, say that is better to go to school.
In my opinion, distance learning is the best form of education. First of all, if you study remotely you can be anywhere and there is no need to interrupt medication. Besides, studying remotely allows to make comfortable atmosphere which will help you to be productive. Moreover, if you do not have to go to school you will not carry a heavy bag.
Some people who disagree with my point of view saying that is better to go to school to get education. They are sure that school has special atmosphere that is not anywhere else. More than that they say that while studying at school your friends always can help you.
I totally disagree with them because even at home it is possible to create an atmosphere that will motivate you for studying. Besides, at school Vera a lot of people and of course they can help you but they also can distract you.
To sum up, I would like to say that there are different forms of getting but I believe that distance learning is the best form of education.
