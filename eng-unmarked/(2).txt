The changes that people have caused to the ecology, especially climate, are drastic. Some people think that man-made change of climate puts the whole civilization at risk. Whereas, others believe that this change is not very dangerous and it is possible to solve this problem.
As far as I am concerned, man-made climate change is a huge threat to humanity. Firstly, a lot of cities can be flooded because of a man-made climate change. The global warming causes the ice to melt which leads to the rise of the ocean levels, so it poses a threat to a cities located on the seaside. Moreover, climate change affects human’s body in a drastic way. Bigger and bigger amount of sun radiation reaches the ground because of the ozone depletion. Unfortunately, radiation can cause severe diseases, including cancer.
However, other people have a different point of view. According to their opinion, the problem of man-made climate change can be easily solved in the nearest future. There is a fast development of high technologies that can slow down and even stop the climate change.
I do not agree with the opposing ideas, I think that climate change is extremely dangerous and it is impossible to stop it. It has terrible consequences, for example, the sources of fresh water dry out because of climate change. Lack of fresh water can be a real problem for humanity.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that man-made climate change is a threat. People should take action in order to avoid its terrible effects.
