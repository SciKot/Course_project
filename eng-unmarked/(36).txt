In the modern world, the cinematography is the most popular way to relax and get positive emotions. Based on this, some people believe that a person, who wants to see a movie, must check reviews before going to a cinema, whereas other people think that it is not a necessity at all.
  As far as I am concerned, filmgoers do not have to read reviews before watching a film. Firstly, every review is always judgmental. Everyone has their own point of view, so critics’ opinion does not always match ordinary viewers’ opinion. Secondly, some critics are too serious about films: they look for mistakes in script, editing, directing, acting and so on too intentionally. Some films are just so bad, that they are even loved by millions (For instance, the movie «The Room» is sohilariously terrible, that people are still enjoying it). Sometimes critics do not understand this fact.
  But there is another point of view. According to it, reviews must be checked by every filmgoer. The adherents of this theory think thatthe majority opinion is the true one, so reviews can save people money and time.
  I do not agree with the opposing opinion. If a film has a billion bad reviews, there is still a chance that this film will be loved by someone.
  In conclusion, I would like to stress that reviews are not so important. It is always better to form an opinion than listening to someone’s one.
