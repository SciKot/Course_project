There are two different opinions on distance learning. Some people say it is the best way to study. Others, On the contrary, say it is impractical. I'd like to express my point of view on this problem.
In my opinion, distance education is a really great way to study. To begin with, educating at home gives you time advantage. That means to complete a task you do not have to spend so much time to look decent for going to school, so you can start studying right away. Besides, people who are more comfortable to work alone then in a classroom full of people take a great advantage out of distance studying because they are able to learn something in a right way for themselves.
However, there are people who oppose. They are sure that studying on the distance is not so practical as some of us believe. For instance, some students might not take this kind of medication seriously, so they will not do tasks even more often when if they do it at school. 
I strongly disagree with this point of view because if a person is interested in getting an education and good grades they will not just let it go and distance education system does not depend on it.
All in all, distance learning might not be the best but actually is a great form of education.
