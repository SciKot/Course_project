Sports are quite popular nowadays. Some people say that team sports are more helpful in building a character, others argue that individual sports are also significant in this process. In this essay, I would like to express my point of view on this issue.
As far as I am concerned, team sports make people more responsible for all their actions because doing something incorrectly they may let their team down. Also, in team sports, a person learns how to communicate with others and take leadership. Thus, group sports makes a person more confident through responsibilities and leading. 
However, there is another point of view claiming that individual sports can build strong character, too. For instance, a competition of individual sportsmen may be much more difficult because each of the competitors wants to win and does everything to make it possible. 
I do not agree with the above ideas because team sports teach people to take care of others, while individual ones make them egoistic. In my opinion, egoism demonstrates a lack of character strength. So, individual sports cannot develop such a strong personality as team sports do.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that team sports are more significant because they help people develop a stronger character than individual sports do and it is undeniable.
