There are two different opinions on making pupils read on their Holidays. Some people say it is not right. Others, in the contrary, say that reading a lot of literature indicates and improves brain.
I believe, it is wrong to make pupils read a lot in summer. To begin with, children do not always have an opportunity to spend hours reading during the Holidays. They might have their own plans, for example, traveling or even self-educating.
Besides, kids should be able to decide if they are interested in reading or not. Some of them might be into more creative things to do. Like drawing or playing different instruments.
However, there are people who argue that is very important to make pupils read literature while they are out of school. For example, reading books enlightens and improves child's brain, that makes them more ready for upcoming school year.
I strongly disagree with this opinion because books are not the only thing in the world what does not let a kid’s fair had become blunt.
All in all, making pupils spend their free time on reading tons of mostly boring books is completely wrong.
