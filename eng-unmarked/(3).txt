Some people think, that sport unites people, while the others think, that it is definitely not right. So, it is a great topic to disquss. 
As for me, I believe that sport can not work in the bad side, only in the good side of our life. Because it is a great way to spent time together, side by side. Also, I think, that with the help of sport you can meet new friends. Besides, I am convinced that if you and your friend have the same sport activity, you become more closer.
Nevertheless, some people believe that sport make people very nervous and exousted. More than that they think that sport is just a waste of time.
I do not fully agree with that, because sport help people to relax physically and mentally. Also, sport is the best thing for time spending for your and your family, because there are a lot of different kinds of sport which specially were made for family
In conclusion, I would like to say that sport is great thing, that allows us to spend our time not only just for fun and joy, but also for our good health and our happy future.
