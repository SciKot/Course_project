There are two opposite points of view on distance education. Some people are sure that it is a good example how we can study. Others On the contrary argue that there are a lot of disadvantages buy this field. I'd like to express my point of view on this problem .
I am strongly Convinced the distance learning is the best form of education. First of all, you can at any time and at any place get an opportunity to study and learn something new. Secondly you can get enough sleep and also go about your business hobbies and so on.
However, some people think differently. They are sure distance in education Noticeably worseus its quality. However when you stay at home you do not go anywhere and it can be a problem for you as you rarely see friends .Besides not everyone has the ability access there Internet someone does not even have a computer at home .
I am absolutely sure that they are wrong because we leave at 21 century where everywhere there is the possibility of access to the Internet. You can also see friends maybe on Skype so that you differently will not stay alone.
In conclusion I would like to say the distance learning is the best way to educate. There is a lot of advantages. it is more conveniently then a simple learning.
