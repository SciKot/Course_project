Nowadays a lot of people spend their money on new projects or researches. For example billions of dollars are spent on space exploration projects every year. 
I think it is not right. Our Earth needs some helpness from goverments from different countries. People have a lot of problems in medicine. We have illnesses like cancer with which people don’t know how to fight  We will know everything about spaces, but nothing about our health, our life on Earth. Is that right? No, I think. 
We should take care about each other and our goverment should spend money on people, on life’s troubles. Government should spend money on our grandmothers and grandfathers, take care about nature, because we have problems with atmosphere. We know about pollution but we don’t want to find the solution about this problem. We should take care about our animals who are in danger. We should take care about poverty, we shall think about it. A lot of people need our help, our money, because they don’t have something to eat. We should think about children, whose parents denyed from them when they were born. They are lonely and need our help. 
To sum up I think that we can spend our money on new projects but we should remember one rule “we are people and we need each other. We need help from each other”.
