There is an opinion that people use technology to do a lot of things. For example, they use computers to work and mobile phones to communicate with others. Some people think that it is normal to use so much devises all day long while others think now it takes too much time.
I strongly believe that people spend too much time using their devices. Unfortunately, in modern world they use them more than they use their minds. Firstly, students often use a calculator in the phone during the tests to do simple computations. They have become too lazy to do it in their head. Secondly, people spend a lot of time on the Internet. Hereupon the amount of their live communication with people have significantly reduced.
However, there are people who oppose. They claim that there is no need to stop using devices so much because it is comfortable to use it. The reducing of time, for example, would slow down business. Also, mobile phones make it much easier to keep in touch with other people, particularly when we’re far away from home.
Nevertheless, I do not agree with the opposing opinion. People may just decrease using devices. We have not completely exclude them from our lives. We should limit ourselves to this. It would bring positive results, our well-being will improve, we will begin to think deeper.
To sum up, I would like to stress that technology is useful, but people have to limit time of using it, be careful to not use it too much. This reducing will awaken their brain and consciousness.
