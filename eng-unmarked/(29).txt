There are two different opinions on heaven true friends . Some people say the person can only have one faithful friend. Others on the contrary argue there can be more of them.
In my opinion a person can have several true friends. To begin with you can communicate with a great amount of people ,share interests with them and consequently there is a big chance to find people you can trust and who will support you love you and no matter what . In addition, you can be sure that those friends will not betray or abuse you which means the what quantity of friends does not depend on how good and faithful they are.
However, there are people who oppose they believe a true friend for us exists only in one kind. It Is difficult to find someone to fully understand you a person you are completely sure in and the one you can unconditionally trust?
I totally disagree with this opinion because even if it is hard to find at least one true friend it happens and happens quite often.  So, the possibility of some number of people being one’s through friends is actually big.
All in all, true friends can be presented in all amount of a few and not only one person can play this role in your life.
