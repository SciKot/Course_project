There are two opposite points of view on friendship.Some people are sure that for all your life you can have only one true friend.Others,on the contrary,argue that you can have many true friends.I would like to express my point of view on this problem.
    It seems to me,you can have more true friends than one.Here are some arguments which support my point of view.To begin with, usually friends are people with the same interests.In the world there are a lot of people with the same tastes as you so there can be many close friends.Furthermore,a group of close friends may consist of your family and this is a few people.
     There are people with a different point of view.They argue that everyone can have only one friend.The most obvious argument is people can’t share their life with others.They think that their friends can spread the secrets.
      I am absolutely sure that these people are wrong.People that can spread your secrets are not your friends,they are not loyal.You should find friends better.
      In conclusion,I would like to underline that you can have many friends which support you and will be loyal.The main thing is to be able to be friends with good people and to be a good friend to them.
