Some people prefer reading books, but other people think that it better to watch film version. For my mind, this problem is very actuality today, because there are many good books and interesting films were shot by this books.
I think, that people should read books and after that watch film versions of this books. For me, this is the right way.
There are many bad films. And if you do not read the book, you will have a wrong opinion about this piace of art. But it is not right! 
For me, if you read a book, you become more  clever, more wiser. When you read your brain is working. When you read, you can know what  a writer thiks, when he writes  this book. And this is very mainly when you are reading.
But when you watch television or book’s film version you become stupid, I think. Your brain does not work so hard, because it is more easier to watch the film then to read a book.
In conclusion  I want to say that people should read books. And after that if they want, they should watch this film. But reading books it is necessary, for my mind.
