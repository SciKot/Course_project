Some people think that authorities have to financially support such activities as painting, composing music, photography, woodwork while others claim that it is unnecessarily. I would like to express my point of view on this issue.
I strongly believe that art needs support. Firstly, it leading us to open our minds and think in new ways about our own lives. Arts and crafts encourage people to experiment. There are no rules in such activities. Secondly, a good well-rounded education have to consists of study of the arts and sciences. We need it to have something to compare with in our future. Also, studying these two areas broadens our horizons.
There is another side to the issue. My opponents claim that that there is no need to spend any budget money on art. There are more important areas whose problems need to be solved primarily. Therefore, government should direct money to deal with these issues and state budget should not be wasted on art.
Despite my respect to the opposing opinion, I agree with it. It should be remembered that there have always been a lot of problems which people have to solve but everlasting values always exist. Many people delight ancient paintings. The beauties of the past inspire some people. It means art have to be financed.
To sum up, I would like to stress it is necessary to support creative people and creativity in general. It develops, improves people. Unfortunately, without money many kinds of art would not survive. But we can stop this extinction.
