English has become the most popular language to learn nowadays. Some people say that it is overrated, while others argue that learning English is significant in the modern world. In this essay, I would like to express my point of view on this issue.
As far as I am concerned, English is an international language, and many people all around the world use it on an everyday basis. Also, it is a language of art and culture. Lots of films, musicals, books, songs create in English. So, a person who is interested in arts can consume content in the language of the original, in the most enjoying way.
However, there is another point of view claiming that people overemphasize it. For example, with this obsession with English, many of them forget about other beautiful languages, such as French which is actively used in arts, too.
I do not agree with the above ideas because even with the overwhelming popularity of English people continue learning other languages. Moreover, in many cases English background helps to acquire new languages. Thus, there is no reason to distress.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that people pay not too much attention to learning English nowadays. They do a good job and educate themselves, which is undoubtedly amazing.
