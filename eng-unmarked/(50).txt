Choosing a film to watch is never easy. Some people think that it is better to rely on the reviews when considering watching a movie. Whereas, others believe that reviews are not helpers in such situation.
As far as I am concerned, filmgoers should really take reviews into consideration when choosing a movie. To begin with, reviews can help decide whether the film is worth seeing or not. Other people’s opinion might help someone save his/her money and time. Moreover, reviews can give some peculiarities and interesting facts about films. These things can interest a filmgoer in seeing them.
Although, some people have a different point of view. In their opinion, relying on reviews is not rational when choosing a movie. Every person is different and has his/her own tastes and preferences, so it is impossible to choose a movie just by relying on the reviews. A filmgoer might prefer something that other people do not like, or the other way around.
I do not agree with the opposing ideas. The reviews usually give a clear picture about the film. Filmgoers do not rely on one or two reviews, they read many of them. When a lot of people have the same opinion about the movie, there is a small chance that the chooser will have a different point of view.
To sum up, I would like to stress that relying on reviews when choosing a film is a great idea. The rate of the movie is definitely something that should be considered when choosing something to watch.
