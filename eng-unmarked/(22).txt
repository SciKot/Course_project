There are two opposite opinions on whether live in a megapolis has much more bed sides then good sides. Some people believe that life in a big city is the best life ever. Others, оn the contrary, are sure that living in a mega Polis brings more problems than positive things. 
I personally Consider that there are more advantages then disadvantages in living in a big city. Here are some arguments that support my point of view. Firstly, you can find an apartment that   Suits you as there are hundreds of alternatives. Secondly, it is easier to get the job you want because of the variety of city professions. Thirdly, there are much more entertainments and places to visit in a big city.
nevertheless, some people think differently. According to them, living in a mega Polis has more disadvantages then advantages. To begin with, the air is poluted and the environment is not healthy at all. Apart from this, you never get peace and quiet in a big city.
I cannot agree with the opponents of my idea. in my opinion, the environment in the city is quite healthy is there are a lot of trees, parks and machines that keep the area fresh and clean.
All in all , there are indeed two opposite opinions on this problem . Taking everything said above into consideration I still strongly believe but there are more advantages then disadvantages in living in a big city.
