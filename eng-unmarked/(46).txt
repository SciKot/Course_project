Art is one of the most important things in people's lives. Some people believe that the government should finance the development of art. Whereas others think that art mustn't be financed by the government. 
As far as I am concerned the government should provide funding for the art because many art workers need money nowadays. Many talented artists, actors, and musicians live in poverty. In order to survive, they have to work somewhere else, they cannot fully devote themselves to creativity. If the government helped them financially, they could spend more time to create masterpieces. 
On the other hand, other people believe that the government should not provide funding for the art. They think so because they do not consider creative professions to be professions. They believe that the profession should bring a stable income. If creative people need money, then let them change their profession. 
I do not agree with the above idea because there are not a lot of really talented creative people these days. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that the government should provide funding for the art. A lot of creative people need it. We must help people who do not see the world the way we do. People who can gladden us with their pictures, movies or music.
