There are a lot of products grown using GMOs these days. Some people believe that GMO products must be forbidden. Whereas others think that GMO products can be sold. 
As far as I am concerned the production and sale of GMO products should be banned. Firstly, this is very dangerous for everyone's health. Because of the use of products with GMOs, cancer can develop. Secondly, genetically modified food affect the human immune system. People who eat GMO foods have a bad immune system and often get sick with various viral infections. 
On the other hand, other people believe that GMO products must be sold. Usually they are cheaper because the fruits and vegetables grown with the use of GMOs are growing much faster. This is very important for people who want to save money. 
I do not agree with the above idea because health for a person should be more important than money. Today people save on food and buy genetically modified foods, and tomorrow they have to spend huge amounts of money on medicines. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that everyone must care about health. People do not save on food. I think that the production and sale of genetically modified food must be banned.
