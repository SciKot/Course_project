We all live in a society where it is pretty common that unrelated people live very close to each other. Some people think that neighbours are some of the most important people in one’s life, others argue that friends and family are more valuable. In this essay, I would like to express my point of view on this issue. 
As far as I am concerned, relatives are the most important people in a person’s life. Some close friends also may be as significant as family members. Firstly, they both are worried about all the things happening with their dearest people. Secondly, they take care and wish only the best to each other. Thus, they may seem the closest people.
However, there is another point of view claiming that neighbours are more important. For instance, they are close when an emergency appears. Also, good and warm relationship with them makes the community spirit better. 
I do not agree with the above ideas because neighbours may be rude or unfriendly. Also, sometimes they do not want to communicate, care only about themselves and are self-cautious. Neighbours are not the people who pay attention to each other’s problems. Thus, they cannot be more significant than friends and family. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that close friends and relatives are the most important people in a person’s life because they are the ones who are interested in it as nobody else.
