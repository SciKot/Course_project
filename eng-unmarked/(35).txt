In the modern world, people influence the weather more and more. For instance,people’s intervention in natural phenomena leads to serious climate change. Based on this, some people believe that humans are destroying the planet in the whole and personally themselves by changing climate, whereas other people think that man-made climate change does not affect anything and such things as global warming are just natural phenomena.
  As far as I am concerned, man-made climate change is very dangerous to people. Firstly, every factory (built by humans) in the world emits gases and toxins, which cause global warming which, in turn, poses a threat to everyone’s life. For example, the temperature in Africa is very hot in itself, but global warming will kill everyone who lives on this continent. In addition to this, high temperature kills fish and other animals, so people are got less and less food every day.
  But there is another point of view. According to it, man-madechanging of climate does not affect anything. The temperature on the planet itself rises once a thousand years. It is just nature.
  I do not agree with the opposing opinion because scientists have already proved that people truly affect the planet’s climatebadly by cuttingdown trees and building new factories.
  In conclusion, I would like to stress that humanity creates problems for itself by changing the climate, so everyone must think about possible terrible future before it is too late.
