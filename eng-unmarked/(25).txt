Nowadays pupils and students use the distance way of education .There are different points of view on this topic .Some people are sure that it is the best learning .Some others argue that it is much better to go to school and University and then have distance learning .
In my opinion distance learning is the best form of education. Firstly, it is very convenient for everybody. As you do not have to leave your home. Secondly, you have more free time. So you can calmly prepare for exams and anything else. So improve our results and knowledge.
however, some people are against usefulness of distance. They claim that lose the ability of communication with each other and become asocial. And this fact badly affects our society.
I am strongly against this opinion who say that we are becoming asocial are absolutely wrong. because distance learning also implies video calling. Thanks to it we can see each other and talk.
In conclusion I would like to say that distance learning is really the best form of education. And that way makes education move convenient and effective.
