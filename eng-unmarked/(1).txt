The art is a very important component of everyone’s lives, even though people often do not notice it. Some people think that one of the authorities’ top priorities should be investing in the art. Whereas others believe that the art is not the most important thing to provide funding for and it is better to invest in science.
As far as I am concerned, government should definitely invest in the art. First of all, bigger funding would be a great help for education. For example, schools of art often do not have enough money to provide students with the necessary equipment, so extra funding would help to solve this problem. Moreover, investing in the art would give talented people more opportunities to grow professionally. Thanks to the extra money, there would be more exhibitions or concerts where artistic people would be able to show their works and talents.
However, some people have a different opinion. They claim that funding for the art is unnecessary as long as the government has other problems to solve. Their idea is that authorities should invest in science in order to give people more “practical” education and get new inventions to solve ecological, economical and other problems.
I do not agree with the opposing ideas. Even though the government has many unsolved problems, it should not forget about the art because it is something that can make people happier and more satisfied with their lives.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that authorities should invest in the art because it is an essential part of everyone’s lives.
