There is a saying, «you live and learn». Some people use it to stress that education is significant for each person, but others argue that learning new things is not vitally important. In this essay, I would like to express my point of view on this issue.
As far as I am concerned, education is as valuable nowadays as it has never been before. For example, applying for most of the places people should be good specialists with high qualifications. That is the first reason for the spreading of the global educational cult: students all around the world try hard, specialists get extra qualifications, elderly people study something they did not know before. Thus, education becomes more and more important.Also, education helps people to express themselves. They can start appreciating art or even doing it themselves after they finish studying.
However, there is another point of view claiming that the importance of education is overrated. They say that there are many successful people without any diploma or degree.For instance, some founders of successful companies had finished high school only, but they earn more money than some people with degrees. 
I do not agree with the above ideas, because it all is not about money. Also, it is not necessary to receive a degree. But if a person does not learn anything at all, the person starts degrading and forgetting important things. So, people cannot live normally without learning anything new.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that education is the most important element of each person’s life. Thus, people need to educate themselves all the time to live normal lives.
