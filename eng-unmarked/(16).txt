It is common knowledge that there are a lot of types of studying. Some people say that the distance education is the type of studying. However, some people have a different vision of the situation and are sure that the traditional way of learning is still the best.
In my opinion, is a great alternative to classic lessons and it has a lot of advantages. Firstly, you can have your own schedule when you have to pass all the exams and tests. It is rather convenient than traditional studying. Secondly, distance learning is easy to get as you do not have to go somewhere and spend a lot of time for the road. Moreover, if you have health diseases distance learning is a great option for a person.
However, some people advocate an opposing opinion and explain the situation differently. They might say that a traditional form of studying is better than distance learning and it has a lot of disadvantages. Firstly, the quality of distance is really low as technologies are not still developed and are unable to teach students at a distance. Secondly, people are not so concentrated and are too relaxed while studying at home.
Nevertheless, I do not quite share this position. As I see it, it is easier to analyze information and to learn something when you are relaxed and there is nothing interrupts you.
In conclusion, this issue will forever remain debatable. Still, I think that the distance learning is the best form of learning and it gives a lot of possibilities.
