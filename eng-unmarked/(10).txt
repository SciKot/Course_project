Nowadays, children of 15-16 years old have an opportunity to choose their career path. But can they make a choice that will lead them to a successful life?
To my mind, an early choice of a career is not always the best one. Firstly, not everyone knows what they want to do for the rest of their life in such a young age. Choosing your future job is an important step and you should not be in hurry with that. Secondly, if you choose a kind of a job that you don’t like you will be miserable and unhappy your whole life.
On the other hand, if you choose a future career at a young age you will have a clearer image of your future life. Moreover, you will have plenty of time to prepare to university exams.
But I still believe that young people should not hurry while choosing their career path. Because it is important to know all the aspects of your future job and not only see the good side of it.
Taking into consideration everything said above I may conqlude that the problem of choosing a career path is far from solving yet. There are several opinions. Any of which has its right to exist. Anyway, I believe that only well-thought choice can lead to success.
