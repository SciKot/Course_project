Nowadays pupils are forced to read a lot of literature for summer but most of them think it is wrong.
In my opinion, it is necessary to read in summer. To begin with, reading makes us think wider and expands our horizons. Furthermore , reading helps to remember the right spelling of the words and improve the vocabulary. Finally, reading improves not only literacy but also speech skills.
On the other hand, some people think that it is wrong to make children read during their holidays. They think pupils should relax. To their mind, it is better to communicate and play with their friends than  to read boring books.
I don’t agree with these people. Not every book is so boring as children think and more over  reading helps relive stress.
To sum up, I’d like to say reading is useful for children. People who are read a lot is more interesting companions and they can support any conversation.
