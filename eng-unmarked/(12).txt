People are different in nature. Some take things that happen to them too close to their hearts and get stress with which it is very difficult for them to fight. Other people with strong nature try to overcome the difficulties with which they can forget their problems finding a very useful occupation. One of these occupations is going in for sports. I suppose sports can help people greatly. When they go in for sports they stop thinking about bad things and starts thinking about their health, getting good results they have no time for stress and gried.
The first group of people thinks that it’s no use spending time with their relatives and friends. They start visiting night clubs, drink alcohol and even use drugs in order to forget the problems. But I that only sports helps people fight stress, bad mood and depression. People who are in good sports form can fight with unesses too. Sport can help people find really good friends and have healthy way to life. There are practically no drug wery heavy smokers and drunkers among the sportsmen.
In conclusion I can say that sports is really important in fighting stress, It is very important in our life and I enjoy people who go in for sports.
