It is common knowledge that every school has a summer reading of school literature. Some people believe that students have too much to read in the summer and it is not necessary to read so much. However, some people have a different vision of the situation and are sure that they should read a lot in summer. 
In my point of view, pupils should spend their summer holidays with benefit and reading helps them. To begin with reading improves student’s memory, vocabulary and broadens the pupil’s mind. Also, the teacher gives these books to pupils that will be discussed at school next year and they help them to prepare the knowing of the plot and characters.
However, some people advocate an opposing opinion and explain the situation differently. They sure that students should not read so many books at summer holidays and they should take a rest. Firstly, most of the students cannot read all the books from the list. Secondly, students forget the plot, names, description because of the long time period.
Nevertheless, I do not quite share this position. In my opinion, reading is the most important part in our life and it helps to develop us and it helps to create our world view. Also, it can become a good habit for students.
In conclusion, I would like to say that reading is very beneficial for kids. I think it is not wrong to make pupils read a lot in summer.
