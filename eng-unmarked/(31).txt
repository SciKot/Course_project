There are two opposite points of view on whether distance learning is the greatest way of studying. Some people are sure that distance learning is the number one, while others think that distance learning is not top way of studying. I would like to express my point of view on this problem. 
I am strongly convinced that distance learning is not the best form of education. To begin with, not everyone has the opportunity to study remotely. For example, someone can have a bad internet connection and due to this video lessons may freeze. Moreover, live communication cannot be replaced by the Internet. Technology cannot replace the value of living human communication. 
However, there is another point of view on this issue. Opponents of my view say that distance learning is the best form of education. The reason is it saves time. Not everyone lives enough close to school and because of it they need a lot of time to get to it. 
Nevertheless I cannot agree with the opposite opinion. I am sure that time does not greatly affect learning. 
In conclusion there are two points of view on this issue. I am strongly feel that distance learning is not the greatest way of studying.
