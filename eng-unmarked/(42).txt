There are many genetically-modified products nowadays. Some people say that they should be prohibited, while others argue that there is nothing bad in these foods. In this essay, I would like to express my point of view on this issue.
As far as I am concerned, genetical modifications help farmers to protect their harvest from insects and weather. If they would not use genetical technologies, they would have lost a huge amount of their products each time or have to use chemicals and pesticides. Also, genetically-modified foods do not harm people’s health as, for example, many pesticides do. 
However, there is another point of view claiming that if someone eats a lot of genetically-modified products, this person may become physically ill. For instance, start to suffer from cancer.
I do not agree with the above ideas, because actually, this may happen due to usage of chemically-fertilised foods, not genetically-modified. Thus, genetical modifications are just the saver way to improve the quality of the harvest.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that there is nothing bad in genetical technologies, so, the production and sale of genetically-modified food must not be banned.
