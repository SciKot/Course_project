There are a lot of professions in the world. There are two opposite points of view on professions. Some people think that there are no special professions for women and men, while other people don’t think so. Who is right?
In my opinion, in the world no women’s and men’s professions. Firstly, I would like to stress that after the second world war some women had to work, because men go to the wor. For example, there are a lot of women drivers in the world. Secondly, a lot of women and men want to do their lovely work. As a result we can find a lot of policewomen and business-ladies or we can see a lot of men interested in fashion. We can find that the best modeliers are men. Finally, the most universal professions are teachers and doctors professions. We can see a lot of men and women teachers at school and a lot of men and women in the hospitals.
Nevertheless, some people considering this problem from another angle think that there are women’s and men’s professions. According to them, women cannot be drivers and men cannot be modeliers.
I totally disagree with this opinion, because I know that some women drivers are more professional than some men drivers.
In conclusion, I can say that although some people think that there are specially women’s and men’s professions, I still believe that people must do what they like, no matter what is profession.
