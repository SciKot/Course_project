Nowadays, many people have a choice either to read a book, or just see a movie version of it. But do films give the same impression and emotions? Is there any difference between reading and watching?
From my point of view, nothing in the world can possibly compare to the book, although now there are such strong competitors as the Internet and TV… But only with the help of the book you see everything, every emotion, every event, every detail. Due to the budget and standart length of films, directors are just unable to put all the scenes in to it, so we lose important information. Moreover, you can always take your book with you, read it on your way to work or just keep it in your home library.
However other people think, that reading is a waste of time. Futher more, many of those are sure, that it’s pointless to read, when there  is a perfect chance of watching, but may be it’s just their lazy bones.
To sum up, I would say, that yes, books might be losing their priority and status but they will always remain a good friend of yours and perfect source of information. But it will always be everyone’s personal choice whether to read or not.
