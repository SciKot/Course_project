English is an international language. Some people believe that person should spend a lot of attention to learn English. Whereas others think that knowledge of the English language is not very important in these days.
As far as I am concerned people pay too much attention to learning English nowadays. Firstly, this is necessary for people who want to communicate with foreigners. Many foreigners know English because it is an international language. Secondly, it helps in the work. If a person works with foreigners, he need to know English.
On the other hand, other people believe that skills of English are not important. They believe that it is much more important to know Chinese, for example. There are a lot of Chinese people now, they have a great influence in all spheres of life.
I do not agree with the above idea because knowledge of the English language is very important. In developed countries such as the United States, great Britain, Australia, and others, it is English that is spoken.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that people pay too much attention to learning English nowadays because it is very important for people who want to work and communicate with foreigners.
