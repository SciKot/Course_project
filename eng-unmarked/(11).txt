Nowadays some people believe that if you want to be successful in the future then you need to chose your career when you are young. However, others say that you will be able to make a good choice of a career only when you will be older. 
In my opinion, an early choice of a career is a good way to be successful in life. Firstly, you will have a lot of time to prepare for exams which you will need for your future career. You will get high points and then you can go to university and get good education. Secondly, if you will make an early choice you will learn more and more about your profession, so that will be helpful for you and you will find work without any problems.
However, others sure that you able to decide what kind of profession you should chose only when you will get older. They think that when you are young you can not know where do you want to work and what you will like in the future.
But I do not agree with this point of view because we can see a lot of successful people who achieved many goals because of early choice.
All in all, I would like to say that when you are young you should think about your future career because it will be helpful for you to find right job and to be well paid in the future.
